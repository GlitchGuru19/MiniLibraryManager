Mini Library Manager - A CLI-based library management system

This application provides a simple interface for managing a personal library collection.
Users can perform standard library operations including adding new books, viewing the
complete catalog, borrowing books, and returning previously borrowed items.

Features:
- SQLite database integration for persistent storage
- GORM ORM for simplified database operations
- Interactive command-line menu system
- Book status tracking (available/borrowed)
- Input validation and error handling

Book represents a single book entity in our library system.
This struct defines the structure of a book record with all necessary
attributes for library management operations.

Fields:
- ID: Unique identifier for each book (auto-generated primary key)
- Title: The name/title of the book
- Author: The author's name who wrote the book
- Year: Publication year of the book
- IsBorrowed: Boolean flag indicating if the book is currently borrowed (exported field)
- CreatedAt: Timestamp when the book was added to the system
- UpdatedAt: Timestamp when the book record was last modified

GORM Tags:
- primaryKey: Marks ID as the primary key for database operations
- not null: Ensures required fields cannot be empty in the database
- default:false: Sets the default value for IsBorrowed to false (available)
- json: Defines JSON field names for potential API integration

file-based database perfect for single-user applications. The database
file 'library.db' will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

Panics:
- If database connection fails
- If schema migration encounters errors

- Success messages for connection and migration completion
- SQL queries (when logger.Info is enabled)

This function serves as the central coordinator of the application, managing

an infinite loop that continues until the user explicitly chooses to exit,

Application Flow:

4. Returns to menu display after operation completion
5. Continues until user selects exit option

Input Handling:

- Validates input against available menu choices
- Provides error feedback for invalid selections

Menu Options Routing:
- Option 1: Add Book - Calls addBook() function
- Option 2: List Books - Calls listBooks() function
- Option 3: Borrow Book - Calls borrowBook() function
- Option 4: Return Book - Calls returnBook() function
- Option 5: Exit - Terminates application gracefully
- Invalid: Displays error message and returns to menu

Complete Startup Sequence:
1. Display application welcome banner and startup information
2. Initialize database connection and perform schema migrations
3. Perform necessary startup tasks (data validation, sample data, etc.)
4. Start the interactive menu system for user operations
5. Handle graceful application termination with confirmation

Critical Operations:
- Database initialization (creates library.db file and tables if needed)
- Error handling for startup failures (will terminate if critical errors occur)
- User interface initialization with clear status reporting
- Startup task execution for optimal user experience

The function ensures that all necessary components are properly initialized

related to uninitialized database connections or corrupted data.
